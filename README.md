# Task-Failure-Prediction-in-Cloud-Data-Centers

Objective:
This project focuses on improving the accuracy of predicting task and job failures in cloud data centers by analyzing historical system message logs. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, the goal is to enhance failure prediction models, ensuring greater reliability and availability of cloud services by accurately forecasting task/job success or failure.

Implementation:
Package Importation:

Utilized libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Plotly for data processing, visualization, and model development.

Dataset Exploration:

Conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, attributes, and key patterns.

Data Processing:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features to ensure proper model input.

Data Visualization:

Applied Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate visual insights into data distributions and identify significant patterns.

Data Splitting:

Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation and validation.

Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE:

Implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring a more balanced model training.

Model Development:

Built and trained several machine learning models, including CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Bagging Classifier, to predict task/job failures.

Model Training:

Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and applied techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

Model Evaluation:

Assessed model performance based on key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine effectiveness in predicting task/job failures.

Final Model Selection:

Selected the Bagging Classifier as the final model due to its superior performance across evaluation metrics.

Result Interpretation:

Analyzed the outcomes and derived insights to identify the key factors contributing to task and job failures, enhancing decision-making and cloud service reliability.
